# Fantasy Tounament

This is a one-user-two-player game where one user sets up fighters for two teams and simulates a tournament. 

## Gameplay

At the start of the tournament, the user is prompted to enter the number of fighters for both teams. After that, for each fighter, the game will ask the user to choose the type of character and enter a name for the fighter. The tournament starts after the user supplies the lineup of fighters.

In the tournament, the fighter at the head of each lineup will battle. The winner of each fight gets placed at the end of their lineup, while the loser goes to the top of the loser container. If a fighter has won and has taken damage, a percentage of the damage is restored.

The tournament finishes when one of the teams does not have any more combatants. When the tournament is over, the results are displayed with the option to display the contents of the loser container as well.
